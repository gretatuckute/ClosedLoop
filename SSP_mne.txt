SSP: 
Create projectors:
	1: decompose cov of data containing artifacts
	2: projectors: the components of high variance (are usually noise)
apply projectors:
	1: combine projectors and perform PCA on these 
		- seems to take care of the sign of the projectors with 					respect to each other
	2: keep the projectors that are not linear dependent ones? Get U
	3: calculate projector: proj = np.eye(nchan, nchan) - np.dot(U, U.T)  
	4: apply: ssp_data=np.dot(proj, data)
